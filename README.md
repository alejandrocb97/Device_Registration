# Device_Registration
Here you have all the code of the project. The project was made in Visual Studio using the .net framework 4.8 using C#.

I create the application using application forms. The whole project was uploaded to this directory.

There are 6 forms in this project:
  -Form_Water
  -Form_Electrical
  -Form_Gateway
  -Form_Start
  -Form_Success
  -Form_Fail

## Important files
You have to download "Device_Registration_app.exe", that is the application created. In the file "instructions.pdf" there are instructions of how to use the application (the application is very intuitive anyway). It's very important that you download the folder "Database" in the same directory where you downloaded the .exe because is there where the application is going to create the files with the data.

Also, the "Device_Registration_presentation.ppt" is the same presentation that I will use in the interview. You are free to download it too if you want.
